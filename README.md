This project was bootstrapped with [Create React SSR App](https://github.com/trustworktech/create-react-ssr-app).
## Moretrees
This project is an attempt at creating a web app where awareness towards the conservation of trees is spread and a place where they can donate for the same cause.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://create-react-ssr-app.dev/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
